# Random Graph Generator

This is a side project I have been working on for a while, and this program literally just gathers a bunch of random data in set lists and orders to create a completely random, useless graph.

## How To Use

***Just press any of the buttons you see on the application.***

## The Fourth Button

This button creates a VERY random graph based off of a seed you input into a text box in the program, **if there is nothing in the textbox the program will throw an error.**
